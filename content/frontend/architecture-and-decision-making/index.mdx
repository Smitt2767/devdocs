## Architecture & Decision Making

The most expensive engineering decisions are the ones that are hard to reverse. Framework choices, API contracts, and debt paydown strategy shape the entire codebase for years. This section covers the frameworks and tools for making those decisions deliberately — and for documenting them in a way that survives team turnover.

This section sits last intentionally. The patterns here only make sense with the context of everything that came before — you need to understand rendering models, bundling tradeoffs, and delivery infrastructure before you can make good framework and architecture decisions.

## What's covered

**Framework Selection Criteria** — How to evaluate frontend frameworks beyond "what's popular" — team familiarity, ecosystem maturity, rendering model fit, migration cost, and long-term maintenance risk.

**API Contract Design** — Designing API contracts between frontend and backend that are explicit, versioned, and evolvable — schema-first approaches, breaking vs non-breaking changes, and how to coordinate contract changes across teams.

**Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** — The lightweight document format for recording architectural decisions — what was decided, why, and what alternatives were rejected. Covers structure, tooling, and how to make ADRs a living part of the codebase rather than historical artifacts.

**Technical Debt Identification & Prioritization** — How to distinguish debt that compounds from debt that's stable, how to quantify its cost to make it legible to non-engineers, and how to prioritize paydown against feature work.
