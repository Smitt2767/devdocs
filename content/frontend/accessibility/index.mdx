## Accessibility

Accessibility is not a checklist — it's an understanding of how users who rely on assistive technology experience your UI, and how the browser exposes that UI to them. This section covers the browser and AT mechanics underneath the ARIA spec, not just which attributes to add.

The section starts with the browser model that underpins all accessibility, then moves through the dynamic content patterns that break it most often, then interaction design, and finally visual considerations.

## What's covered

**Accessibility Tree** — How the browser builds a parallel representation of the DOM for assistive technologies — which elements are included, how roles and properties are computed, and how the tree changes when the DOM changes.

**ARIA Live Regions Internals** — How `aria-live`, `aria-atomic`, and `aria-relevant` instruct screen readers to announce dynamic content changes — and the exact timing and queuing behavior that causes announcements to be missed or duplicated.

**Focus Management in SPAs** — How client-side navigation breaks the browser's default focus behavior and what you must do to restore it — moving focus to the right element after route changes, modal opens, and dynamic content insertions.

**Keyboard Navigation Patterns** — The interaction patterns that keyboard users expect: arrow key navigation within composite widgets, roving tabindex, keyboard shortcuts, and the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide patterns for menus, tabs, and dialogs.

**Pointer Events** — How `pointer-events`, `touch-action`, and the Pointer Events API unify mouse, touch, and stylus input — and the accessibility implications of touch-only interaction patterns.

**Color Contrast & Reduced Motion** — WCAG contrast requirements, how to audit contrast programmatically, and how to respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for users who experience motion sickness or vestibular disorders.
