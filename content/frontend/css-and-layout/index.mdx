## Overview

This section isn't about CSS syntax — it assumes you know how to write CSS. It's about the performance, architectural, and browser-internals questions that come up when CSS is applied at scale: why certain properties trigger layout, how to contain style recalculations, and how to design a token system that survives a design system rewrite.

## What's covered

**CSS Containment** — The `contain` property tells the browser a subtree is independent from the rest of the page, enabling aggressive rendering optimizations. Essential for large lists, widgets, and component libraries.

**Layout Thrashing** — What happens when JavaScript alternates between reading and writing layout properties, forcing the browser to recalculate layout repeatedly in a single frame. How to batch reads and writes to avoid it.

**CSS Architecture Trade-offs** — CSS Modules, utility-first (Tailwind), CSS-in-JS, and vanilla CSS — their trade-offs in specificity, runtime cost, bundle size, and developer ergonomics at different scales.

**Animation Performance** — Which CSS properties are GPU-composited (`transform`, `opacity`) and which trigger layout or paint. How to use `will-change` correctly and when it does more harm than good.

**Theming & Design Tokens** — Using CSS custom properties as a token layer — semantic naming, theme switching, component-level overrides, and how to structure tokens for a multi-brand or multi-theme system.

**Responsive Design Strategies** — Container queries vs media queries, intrinsic sizing, fluid typography with `clamp()`, and the modern approaches that replace breakpoint-heavy layouts.
