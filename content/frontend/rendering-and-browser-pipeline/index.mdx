## Rendering & Browser Pipeline

This section covers the full stack from raw bytes to painted pixels. Understanding the rendering pipeline is foundational — performance bugs, layout shifts, and hydration mismatches all trace back to misunderstanding how the browser and React coordinate work.

Topics span two layers: the **browser's internal pipeline** (critical rendering path, compositing, GPU acceleration, paint vs layout) and **React's rendering model** (fiber architecture, reconciliation, hydration, concurrent features, streaming SSR).

## What's covered

**Hydration & SSR** — How server-rendered HTML gets "activated" on the client, and how partial and selective hydration reduce the cost of that activation.

**Streaming SSR** — How React 18 streams HTML in chunks so users see content before the full server response completes.

**Concurrent Rendering** — How React schedules and prioritizes rendering work to keep UIs responsive under heavy load.

**Browser internals** — The critical rendering path, render-blocking resources, compositing layers, and how CSS properties map to GPU-accelerated work.

**Render waterfalls** — How sequential data fetching chains compound latency and how to break them with parallel fetches and Suspense.
