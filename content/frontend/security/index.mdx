## Security

Frontend security is not just about libraries and headers — it's about understanding how attacks work at the browser level and building defenses that address the root cause rather than the symptom.

The section moves from the most common active attacks, through browser-enforced defenses, to the code-level and dependency-level risks that are easier to overlook.

## What's covered

**CSRF vs XSS Mitigation** — The two most common web attacks, how they work mechanically, and the specific mitigations for each — `SameSite` cookies for CSRF, output encoding and CSP for XSS.

**Content Security Policy** — Browser-enforced allowlists that restrict which scripts, styles, and resources can load on your page. The most effective defense against XSS after it's bypassed your input validation.

**Trusted Types** — A browser API that enforces safe DOM manipulation by preventing raw string injection into dangerous sinks like `innerHTML` and `document.write`.

**Secrets Management** — Keeping API keys, tokens, and credentials out of the client bundle — where they belong in the server environment, how to validate them at startup, and how to audit for accidental exposure.

**Prototype Pollution** — A JavaScript vulnerability where user-controlled input can inject properties into `Object.prototype`, silently affecting all objects in the runtime. Common in data-merging utilities processing untrusted JSON.

**Dependency & Supply Chain Risks** — The attack surface introduced by third-party packages — malicious packages, compromised maintainers, typosquatting, and the tooling that helps you audit and lock your dependency tree.
