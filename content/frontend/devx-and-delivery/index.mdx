## Overview

Writing code is only part of the job. Shipping it safely, monitoring it in production, and maintaining the systems that let a team work effectively at scale are equally important. This section covers the delivery infrastructure that sits around your application code.

## What's covered

**Feature Flags & Progressive Rollouts** — Decoupling deploys from releases. How feature flag systems work, the difference between a kill switch and a percentage rollout, and how to target flags by user segment, region, or cohort without coupling flag logic to your component tree.

**CI/CD Pipelines for Frontend** — What a modern frontend pipeline looks like: type checking, linting, unit tests, build verification, bundle size checks, Lighthouse CI, preview deployments, and post-deploy smoke tests.

**Error Tracking & Observability** — Capturing and grouping frontend errors with source map symbolication, setting up session replay for reproduction, and the difference between error rate, error volume, and user impact as metrics.

**Internationalization (i18n) Architecture** — Structuring a Next.js app for multiple locales: locale detection and routing, message loading strategies, pluralization and date formatting, and avoiding the common patterns that make i18n expensive to add after the fact.

**Design System Ownership & Versioning** — How to publish and version a shared component library used by multiple teams — semantic versioning, changelog discipline, migration paths for breaking changes, and the organizational models (inner source, platform team) that make it sustainable.
