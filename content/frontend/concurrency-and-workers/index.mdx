## Concurrency & Workers

JavaScript's single-threaded model means all script execution, layout, and painting compete for the same thread. When expensive computation blocks that thread, the UI freezes. Browser workers provide a way to run code in parallel — but they come in two distinct forms with very different roles, and confusing them is a common mistake.

## What's covered

**Web Workers vs Service Workers** — The core distinction: Web Workers are general-purpose background threads for CPU-intensive computation (data parsing, image processing, cryptography). Service Workers are network proxy threads for offline support, caching, and push notifications. They have different lifecycles, different APIs, and different failure modes. This article covers both in detail — when to use each, how they communicate with the main thread, and the gotchas that catch developers who assume they work the same way.
