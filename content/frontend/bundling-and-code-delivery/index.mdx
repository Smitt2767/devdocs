## Bundling & Code Delivery

The gap between writing code and users running it is larger than it seems. Bundlers, module systems, CDNs, and resource hints all shape what gets downloaded, in what order, and how fast. This section covers the tooling and strategies that sit between your source files and the browser.

The section is ordered to build understanding progressively: first understand what ships and why, then learn to measure it, then learn to optimize delivery, then tackle scale.

## What's Covered

**Tree Shaking Internals** — How bundlers use static analysis of ES module imports to eliminate dead code. Covers ESM vs CommonJS, the `sideEffects` field in `package.json`, the `/*#__PURE__*/` annotation for factory calls and class expressions, scope hoisting, CSS side-effect allowlists, Rollup's `treeshake` config, Turbopack vs Webpack 5 differences, and how to verify tree shaking on production builds.

**Code Splitting Strategies** — Route-level, component-level, and vendor splitting. `next/dynamic` with SSR control, `React.lazy` + `Suspense`, webpack magic comments (`webpackChunkName`, `webpackPrefetch`, `webpackPreload`), `loading.tsx` for route-level Suspense in the App Router, explicit vendor chunk configuration, and why over-splitting hurts more than it helps.

**Bundle Analysis & Dependency Auditing** — Using `@next/bundle-analyzer` for the interactive treemap, `source-map-explorer` for file-level attribution, `size-limit` to enforce bundle budgets in CI, `npm audit` for security vulnerabilities, `knip` for unused dependencies, and `npm ls` plus `overrides` for duplicate package detection and resolution.

**Preload, Prefetch & Priority Hints** — The full set of browser resource hints: `preload` with the mandatory `as` attribute, `modulepreload` for ESM, `prefetch` for next-navigation speculation, `preconnect` for connection warming, `dns-prefetch` for low-cost DNS resolution, `fetchpriority` on LCP images, Next.js `<Image priority>` and `<Script>` loading strategies (`afterInteractive`, `lazyOnload`, `worker`), and the Speculation Rules API for full-page pre-rendering.

**Monorepo Tooling** — pnpm workspaces with the `workspace:*` protocol for internal package linking, pnpm catalogs for centralized dependency version management, Turborepo's task pipeline (`turbo.json`), `^build` vs `build` in `dependsOn`, `--affected` filtering for CI efficiency, task graph visualization, remote cache setup with Vercel and self-hosted options, and the peer dependency rule for shared framework packages.
